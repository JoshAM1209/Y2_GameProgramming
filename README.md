Tutorial 1: Planning on creating a tutorial for a basic health system. To start with I plan to create the entire system first so I know what will/won't need to be covered by the tutorial and be able to adjust accordingly
After spending a little bit of time refreshing my memory on what I need to do in order to create this system, I have created a functioning, albiet extremely basic health system using triggers and tags. A script on the player object stores values for the player's maximum health and current health. Each trigger has a tag that determines weather entering it will decrease or increase the players health.
